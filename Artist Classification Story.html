									<h1>Artist <br />
										Classification </h1>
					
								<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
								<p>This project was made by me , the main goal is to build a website where you can drag and drop a picture of an artist and it will identify them , 
									i have limited the image classification to only three of my favorite musicians.</p>
								</header>
								<a href="https://github.com/spicyhesus/ArtistClassifictation" target="_blank" class="image fit"><img src="images/website screenshot.PNG" alt="" /></a>
								
								<h3>I-Data Collection</h3>
								<p>To train our classifier we need a ton of pictures .<br> 
									There are three ways of doing this , first being the manual way in which we manually download images from google which is not very optimal
									 ,resource heavy and time consuming .<br>
									Second one is web scrapping but we can't be sure about the consistency of this method plus its a gray area in terms of legal implications .<br>
								The third and the one i ended up using is the google chrome extension Fatkun which allows us to mass download selected images and filter them by width and height .</p>

								<h3>II-Data Cleaning</h3>
								<p>Getting our images from the internet might come with a couple of setbacks , in our case we need images containing only the face of a human being .
									Knowing that , not every image will satisfy that condition and be ready to use so we need to get our hands dirty and do some cropping .
									Alongside that , we only want to keep the pictures where a face and two eyes are clearly visible and easily deteced , for this process we will be using
									Haar Cascade technique from OpenCv which is a famous image processing library .
								  </p>
								
								<h3>III-Feature Engineering</h3>
								<p>In this step we will be extracting facial features using a technique called wavelet transform so we can create our datasets which will be used in training our model.</p>
								
								</p>
								<h3>IV-Model Training</h3>	
								<p> Now that we're set to train our model , we're going to use GridSearch to try out different models with different parameters to distinguish which is the best for our case
									our candidates are : SVM , random forest and logistic regression ,
									there was no big difference between SVM and logistic regression.
									However random forest wasn't well suited so we went with SVM .</p>

								<h3>V-Flask Server</h3>
								<p> At this stage , we're building a flask server using python for our project , honoring the ropes of the workflow of building a project where a data scientist will build the model and the engineering team will build the server.
									 </p>
								<h3>VI-Website</h3>
								 <p> In the final step , we built a UI website for our project via simple HTML,css, java script.
