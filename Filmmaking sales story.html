									<h3>NOTICE</h3>
								<p>Characters and company names depicted in this project are fictious and are only used to give the project more depth. </p>
								<h3>INTRODUCTION and problem statement</h3>
								<p>B25 is a world wide studio that provides filmmakers with equipement to be used on movie sets , one of the regional sales director notices a decline in sales in india ,
									he decides that a revenue breakdown by city , years and months is mandatory to troubleshoot the issue and make more accurate decisions in the future .</p>
								</header>

								<h3>I-Data Discovery</h3>
								<p> After the sales director realises his pain , he called in a meeting with different departments from the organization such as the IT team , Data analysis team ,etc.. 
									The tool he used to brain storm was Aim's grid which contains 4 components the first one being the purpose which in our case is to unlock sales insights that are not visible for sales team.
									<br>
									The second component is the stakeholder which could be the sales director , marketing team , data & analytics team, etc..
									<br>
									The third is the end result , for our case the end result is an automated dashboard providing quick latest sales insight in order to support data driven decision making.	
									<br>
									the fourth and the last is the success criteria , can be achieved when the dashboard covers sales order insights with latest data available ,
									sales team able to take better decisions and sales analysts stop data gathering manually .
								</p>

								<h3>II-Data Analysis using SQL</h3>
								<p>In this step we will be taking a closer look at our database by running simple querries to better understand the data and how our dimensions are related .</p>
								
								<h3>III-Data cleaning and ETL in Tableau</h3>
								<p>At this point of the project our data is ready to be treated , we will be using tableau to filter any abnormalities such as missing values or outliers and normalize values such as currency if needed ,then choose the convenient schema for our data to work with ,
									we ended up choosing the star schema since we have a dimension called "transactions" that holds measurements and can be used as a fact table.
								</p>
								<h3>IV-Building the dashboard</h3>	
								<p> There are several components to be created when it comes to building the dashboard , for our purpose we will be creating a total of 9 elements , 2 of which are suited as filters .</p>

								<h4>1-Total Revenue</h4>	 
								<p>Displays the sum of normalized sales amount </p>	

								<h4>2-Sales Quantity</h4>	 
								<p>Displays the sum of sales quantity </p>		

								<h4>3-Revenue by markets </h4>	 
								<p>Used to help us tell which market has the highest sales amount </p>

								<h4>4-Sales quantity by markets </h4>	 
								<p>Displays sales quantity for each market </p>	

								<h4>5-Top 5 customers </h4>	 
								<p>Displays top 5 customers with highest sales amount </p>	

								<h4>6-Top 5 products </h4>	 
								<p>A sheet that displays top 5 products with highest revenue </p>	
								
								<h4>7-Top 5 products </h4>	 
								<p>A sheet that revenue by year and extendable to show us more detailed insights about revenues for each month  </p>	

								<h4>7-Year and Month filters </h4>	 
								<p>Both are used as a filter to display data for a given month or year or both   </p>
