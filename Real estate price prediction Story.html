									<h1>Real Estate price prediction </h1>
									
								<h3>INTRODUCTION </h3>
								<p>In this project we assume that we are a data scientist working for a real estate company and we're asked to build a model that can predict property price based on certain features  .</p>

								<h3>I-Data Cleaning</h3>
								<p> One of the first steps in data science projects is data cleaning , while we're at it , we can reach a better understanding of the data at hand.
								</p>

								<h3>II-Feature engineering</h3>
								<p>Second layer of the project , we're looking at feature engineering and dimensionality reduction .
									We're going to create a column called price per square feet which will help us with outlier removal in later stages </p>
								
								<h3>III-outilers removal</h3>
								<p>
									We've reached the level where we should get rid of outliers . 
									Outliers are the data points that represent the extreme values of a dataset,
									keeping them could alter the results or contribute to the inacuracy we get in the final stage.  
									
								</p>
								<h3>IV-Model building</h3>	
								<p> We cleaned up our dataframe and made it ready for model building ,
									 its only convenient to start building our machine learning model and use k-fold cross validation to estimate the reliablity of the model 
									 and GridSearchCv to come up with the most suited model for our purpose.</p>
								<h3>V-python flask server</h3>	
								<p>Now that he model is built (linear regression) and the artifacts are exported ,
									 the next step would be to write a python flask server which concerns HTTP requests made from the ui we're going to build. </p>
								<h3>VI-Website UI</h3>	
								<p> Since we have our flask server ready which will be used as a back end for our website , 
									we are now going to build that website which acts as a UI for our project.</p>

								<h3>VII-Deployement to cloud</h3>	
								<p> The final stage of the workflow is deploying our machine learning model to production ,
									we are going going to deploy the project to amazon EC2.
									on the same instance we will have our website as well as our flask server running.
									we will be using a ubuntu virtual machine on which we will be installing ngnix.
