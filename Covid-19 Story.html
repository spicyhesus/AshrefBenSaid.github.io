									<h1>Covid-19<br />
									Dashboard by Team LinkIT </h1>
									<h3>SPECIAL THANKS</h3>
								<p>  I want to thank everyone that participated in this project or was a part of it , i want to thank my teammates , Hamza Merhabene , Yessin fradj ,mariem miled, marouen karoui and our professor Haddi Mariem who was our guide throughout this project . </p>
								<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
								<p>The end goal of this project is to Create a dashboard using Microsoft Power BI containing charts 
										about the spread of the virus across the country and help the indian goverment predict its next peaks 
										via plots created by implementing machine learning methods then publishing the dashboard
										on a web page .</p>

								<h3>I-Data Cleaning</h3>
								<p>A dataset was handed to us .<br>LinkIT, a group of five students , we started by one of the first steps in the early stages of the project which was cleaning the data ,
									ie:
										Getting rid of duplicates ,
										Fixing structural errors(typos / incorrect capitalization),
										Taking care of outliers (data that contains  absurd,abnormal values ),
										Deleting or Filling missing values based on how it will affect our data,
										Validating the data.
									</p>

								<h3>II-ETL process using talend and Postgresql</h3>
								<p>Since we polished our dataset this stage was relatively easy ,
									 we used Talend Open Studio to extract and load the data into a database for future use (dashboard creation).</p>
								
								<h3>III-Machine Learning</h3>
								<p>At this point of the project it was convenient to decide which algorithms and models would be best suited  for our purpose ,
									 we planned on implementing 3 features : prediction, classification, sentiment analysis.</p>
								<h4>1-Classification</h4>	 
								<p>we made progress with classification because we had the idea of classifying data from the beginning 
									we decided that categorization would be helpful when it comes to the level of infection by state , vaccination rate and the spread rate 
									to implement this we used KNN(K-Nearest-Neighbour) and K-Means clustering.</p>

								<h4>2-Sentiment Analysis</h4>
								<p>Sentiment analysis was an idea we had to understand how the vaccines are affecting the population
									we we started data gathering from twitter via scraping tools then we cleaned the data by removing the stop words to make it ready
									to analyze after we feed it to the algorithm (Linear Regression).</p>

								<h4>3-Peak Prediction</h4>
								<p>Concerning predictions , we thought it would be well suited if we worked with time series ,
									we transformed our data accordingly then trained our model and got an accuracy of 84%.
								</p>
								<h3>IV-Power BI</h3>	
								<p> As we approach the end of this project , its time to put everything we created to use .<br>
									the tool that helped us accomplish this was Microsoft Power BI , we created our dashboard that holds several sheets 
									each containing various sections and sub-sections , eachone dedicated to a field i.e one for machine learning features , one for charts and plots, one for spread map .</p>

								<h3>V-Publishing</h3>
								<p> This is the last stage of this project , we chose to publish the dashboard to our own website that also contains daily real time news about covid , providing the user with full insight about the situation of the virus.
